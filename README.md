## What I Built
This project is a static front-end clone of the YouTube homepage. It replicates the user interface, layout structure, and visual design of the real platform using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates my ability to re-create high-traffic web layouts with pixel accuracy.

## Skills/Tools I Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- CSS Flexbox
- Responsive Design Principles

## What Challenges I Solved
- Achieved pixel-perfect layout matching YouTube's front page
- Used Flexbox to create a flexible and scalable grid layout for video thumbnails
- Managed spacing, alignment, and structure for a complex UI
- Ensured responsive adaptation to different screen widths
